# CodeQuiz

## User Story

AS A coding bootcamp student
I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers

## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and score

## Completed

- html and css designed
- visible and hidden settings make it visually attractive
- timer works
- start button works
- questions cycle through
- prompts use for initials

## Not Working

- i want my choices to appear in a bootstrap button but i dont know how
- choices for next question r appended to choices of previous question
- highscore page is a fail
- submit button stopped working

## To Do

- rewrite highscore page entirely -- i have a separate highscore js, should i also have highscore code on the script ?
- figure out choice buttons and appends
